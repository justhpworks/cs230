1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is the client in question, and they are seeking a web-based gaming application named "Draw It or Lose It" that is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw. They requested a software designed to facilitate gameplay where teams guess phrases based on rendered imagery from a stock library. Some of the key software requirements needed would be managing unique game and team names, handling multiple teams with assigned players, and ensuring only one game instance exists in the memory at any time through unique identifiers.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Personally, I thought that my attention to detail was my particular strength in this document. I tried my best to articulate my words and responses to offer the best fit for the client and what they wanted. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I enjoyed that the document was formatted the way it was, because it made it very easy to work through each section consecutively. I felt more and more accomplished with each section I was able to complete, and it sort of acted in a 'check list' manner to help make the ease of working through it and accomplishing tasks easier. 

When it came to developing the code, the writing I did on the document already created a framework for me to work with and double check my coding with. The UML class diagram was also especially helpful.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Since most of the writing takes place in the Evaluation section, I would probably want to edit and revise it to make it more cohesive. I would probably create a format for each horizontal 'line' and stick to it for each different platform in order to make the answers more easy to follow and streamlined.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Based off of the UML model given along with the initial needs specified in the project guidelines, I used that as a framework to base my coding off of. It was important to read and understand what the client wanted and to implement it as smoothly as possible. If the needs weren't considered, or perhaps not fully met, that could lead to an unsatisfied customer or a lackluster product in the end, which could potentially negatively affect revenue, reputation, and the like in the future.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I definitely used the UML diagram as the framework for the software, and then read through the requirements and the document to see what else was needed. In the future, I would again carefully read the needs of the client and work on the document first before starting the coding of the project. I would definitely want my work reviewed and to have it be tested as I go through it in order to not run into game breaking errors or redundant areas of code.
